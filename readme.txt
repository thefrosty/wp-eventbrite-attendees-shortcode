== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why create this plugin? =

I created this plugin to easily show your attendees from any event you've created on [Eventbrite](http://www.eventbrite.com/r/thefrosty). I orignally wrote a [tutorial](http://wpcult.com/turn-your-rss-feed-into-a-shortcode/) on how to do this, then decided a plugin would work better for WordCamp: [WordCampLA](http://wordcamp.la)
